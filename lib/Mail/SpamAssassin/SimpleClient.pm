=head1 WARNING

B<Achtung!>

This module is still in its infancy.  Its interface will probably change
somewhat, especially if some changes are made to the spamd protocol to make
this module awesomer.  Please don't rely on it.  Just play with it and try to
help figure out how to make it great.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mail::SpamAssassin is a great, free tool for identifying spam messages.  It is
generally accessed via the F<spamc> or F<spamassassin> programs.  Despite the
fact that SpamAssassin in implemented in Perl, it is often difficult to check a
message against SpamAssassin from within a Perl program.

This module provides a very simple (but also limited) interface to check mail
against SpamAssassin.

=method new

  my $client = Mail::SpamAssassin::SimpleClient->new(\%arg);

This method returns a new SimpleClient object.

Valid arguments are:

  host     - the host on which to look for spamd (default: localhost)
  port     - the port on which to look for spamd (default: 783)
  username - username to pass to spamd
  timeout  - how long (in seconds) to allow SpamAssassin to consider the
             message before an exception is raised; default 120;  set to 0 to
             wait forever

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, $arg) = @_;
  $arg ||= {};

  $arg->{host} = 'localhost' unless defined $arg->{host};
  $arg->{port} = 783 unless defined $arg->{port};
  $arg->{timeout} = 120 unless defined $arg->{timeout};

  bless $arg => $class;
}

=method check

  my $result = $spamc->check($message);

This method passes a message to SpamAssassin to be spam-checked.  It returns a
L<Mail::SpamAssassin::SimpleClient::Result> object.  If SpamAssassin does not
respond within the SimpleClient's timeout period, an exception is raised.

sub check {
  my ($self, $message) = @_;

  local $SIG{ALRM} = sub {
    Carp::croak "SpamAssassin failed to respond within $self->{timeout}s";
  };

  # with that when it turns out to matter. -- rjbs, 2007-03-21

=head1 TODO

Support spamd-less operation.

Get the protocol to support "always rewrite" or another way to always get
scores.
